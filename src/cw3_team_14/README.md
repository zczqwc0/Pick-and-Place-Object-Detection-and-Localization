## Contribution
The workload is divided into 3 tasks which each person is responsible for each task.
 - Task 1: Bruce Chou            [Approximate working hour ~48 hours]
 - Task 2: Jiahe Liu             [Approximate working hour ~60 hours]
 - Task 3: Sornsiri Poovongsaroj [Approximate working hour ~80 hours]
During each task, we also exchange ideas and help out in each other's tasks. The code from the prior task is shared so that the functions can be used in the later tasks. Before submission, Sornsiri Poovongsaroj is responsible for combining all the codes from the team members, rearranging the comments and codes in a single format, and writing the README.md.
